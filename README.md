## An open data standard supporting information exchange

Definitions using json schema for the contractual construction and 
operation exchanges of information relating to physical real world assets.

    Provides clear human- and machine- readable documentation.
    Validates data which is useful for:
        Automated testing.
        Ensuring quality of client submitted data.

COIE provides the ability to specify, procure, deliver and assure data in a single unambiguos, open format and interoperable language.

COIE-CORE
